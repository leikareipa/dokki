Dokki is currently work in progress.

## The rest

Since dokki is work in progress, this readme is a bit light on content for the moment. More info will be added in the future as the software matures.

That said, dokki is already running production. You can find a sample of it on [my blog](https://tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/blog/), which is written entirely using dokki.

The contents of the [docs/](./docs) folder are hosted live:
